# [[Emanuel Bjornson]]

**Identity:** Freedom Fighter who battles with Cooking
**Origin:** Verita
**Theme:** Justice
**Quirk:** Agitator

Emanuel Bjornson was born in a small town in Verita called Nikshtota. Nestled in a fertile valley in the mountains full of farms and nature, it was a perfect place for a young Velsicka to fall in love with cooking. As he grew, he started working in the Cake and Bake bakery, hearing tales of Darham as just wild rumors and overblown misconceptions.

Soon, the bakery gained an admirer, in the form of Taylor, a young Tinkermander with a dream of inventing something big one day. After being charmed especially one day by Emanuel's Honey Tarts, he tried to contact him for a business proposition, in which they would start a Bakery in Darham, with Emanuel baking various things, and Taylor thinking of ways to cook deserts. Among these, the first of which Taylor successfully made was the Rotating Oven and Baked Goods Laucher, the Oven Gun or ROBGooL for short, allowing a baker to rapidly bake and serve various goods.

When they finally got to Darham, their naive dreams were soon shattered by discrimination and mistrust. While they could get a bakery in place, it was far too small for their tastes, and they never properly got to expand. However, this soon reached to a head when for hate related reasons, Taylor was abducted, leaving Emanuel in tears. However, Emanuel soon became aware of the One Link, and soon decided to join. Now using the ROBGooL as a memento of his friend, he seeks to literally and figuratively dish out Justice.
