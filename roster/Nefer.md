# [[Nefer|Nefer aka Left Handed Crow]]

A Rogue, Sharpshooter Weaponmaster.

Left Handed Crow (Alias of Nefer)
Identity: Erudite Rogue
Theme: Guilt
Quirk: Heirloom

Nefer, known to her Abbysinian thieves's guild; "The Gloved Hand", as "Left Handed Crow", ran afoul of her "friends" when she stole a forbidden tome of dark magic from the Grand Library of Excezanderia. Unbeknownst to her, the Library was run by a high ranked member of the Guild of the Gloved Hand and the tome she stole was his family's Grimoire. Upon learning this from a Fence affiliated with the Guild, Nefer critically injured the Fence in order to escape his office. She then fled Abyssinia for Durham, taking her new book with her.
