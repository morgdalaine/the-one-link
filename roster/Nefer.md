# [[Nefer|Nefer aka Left Handed Crow]]

A Rogue, Sharpshooter Weaponmaster.

Left Handed Crow (Alias of Nefer)
Identity: Erudite Rogue
Theme: Guilt
Quirk: Heirloom

Nefer, known to her Abyssinian thieves's guild; "The Gloved Hand", as "Left Handed Crow", ran afoul of her "friends" when she stole a forbidden tome of dark magic from the Grand Library of Excezanderia. Unbeknownst to her, the Library was run by a high ranked member of the Guild of the Gloved Hand and the tome she stole was his family's Grimoire. Upon learning this from a Fence affiliated with the Guild, Nefer critically injured the Fence in order to escape his office. She then fled Abyssinia for Durham, taking her new book with her.

On her way to the Western Border between Abyssinia and Durham Nefer met Aria and was given a "Sales Pitch" for "The One Link" After a few questions Nefer signed up, as she had been dreading crossing that border alone. Upon hearing Aria's introduction to the One Link, Nefer agreed to join, as she knew she would not so easily find a place to belong where she was otherwise going.
