**Delphin "Agent Nyx" Graves**
**Identity**: Agent of The Tartarus Association
**Theme**: Duty
**Origin**: Darham
**Quirk**: Revenant

Silence. Perfect, pristine silence. The same silence that has been there for a seemingly infinite amount of time. Time has become meaningless in this infinite void, this unending expanse of black ichor. The only escape from the silence, memory. Memory of family, memory of friend, memory of light. Sweet, warm, gentle light. A faint memory, but a cherished memory at that. The memory of a warm summers day spent in the countryside with your family. A picnic in the hills chasing around the family pet. The beach, sitting beside your mother in a sun hat calmly sunbathing. Normal memories to anyone else, these are imaginations. Fantasies to a being devoid of choices. The memories are fuzzy and the finer details absent like the memory was an old family tale, the details changing every time it's told. The faces blurred the voices a soft murmur behind the ears, the lettering a jumbled mess. But a memory is still a break from the silence, even if they isn't her own. The silence brought a strange solace, though solace is only temporary, for there is work to be done.

The Tartarus Association cannot afford failure after all, and emotion gets in the way of business. An organization devoted to the high societies of Darham, The Tartarus Association deals with matters that those in power would never dirty their hands with. Extorsion, interrogation, _disappearances_, things of that nature. The association also acts as bodyguards for family members of higher importance, such as heirs or heads of families, a sort of natural deterrent for any would-be assassins, that is the job of the association after all. The means that The Tartarus Association recruits their agents is a extremely thorough and intense process, and they cannot afford to lose these valuable assets. While not entirely considered Hindseen, the agents of the Tartarus Association are kept in a constant state of undeath, if they happen to expire before they've outgrown their usefulness, a process known as Rebirth. A violent and sudden procedure where the subjects soul is forcefully retied to their body with the use of science and a little smidge of necromancy.

Delphin was given the moniker _Agent Nyx_, named after the effects that Rebirth had on her. Espionage and assassination became the primary tasks given to her by the association, a job she did with needlepoint precision. Her efforts earned her a second Rebirth after one target became unusually prepared for her attempts. A second Rebirth is rare and often more painful than the first procedure, leaving her with residue from the necromantic energy. The strange ability to harness this residue in the form of shadows and ichor, at the cost of her own vitality. Though any sacrifice in support of the association is a worthy sacrifice.

As tensions rise within Darham, high society talks warn of a coming conflict, and conflict breeds opportunity. Given the nature of her employment Delphin decided to take matters more into her own hands than The Tartarus Association was willing to do. Word spreads fast, and word in the high society circles is that a particular heiress has taken a leave of absence from the spotlight. This venture may prove dangerous, and protection may be required should anyone attempt a threat on her life.
"By the will of Hades, it shall be done."
