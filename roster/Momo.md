# [[Momo]]

**Identity**: Troubled Maid in Disgrace
**Theme**: Doubt
**Origin**: Darham
**Quirk**: Fettered Heart
**Classes**: Dancer 3, Spiritist 1, Fury 1

Momo is a loyal servant to the Glimmerheim family, one of the five head families of Darham. She remembers little of tribes she was born into, only the awe and fear as she was dropped off by the huge buildings with the humans that she would come to see as her family. For reasons that are unclear to her, she was taken in by the Glimmerheims to serve as the personal servant and retainer to their first born child, Iris. Over time Momo became an older sister figure for all the many children the family would come to have. She took care of Iris' daily needs and attended social events as both her companion and bodyguard if need be, having been trained with easily concealable weapons. It was the only life she knew, and one she was content with keeping.

Things changed however. She was no longer allowed to handle valuables, and her tasks took her further and further away from the mansion, from her home and her family. There was clearly some mistrust, but Momo couldn't figure out what she done wrong. Not long ago she was tasked with going out into the world to hone her abilities with spiritualist magic, something she picked up in her original tribe. The problem is that she has no idea how to do this, or who "her people" even are. Then she found The One Link, a place where she might find answers, and do some good in the process.
