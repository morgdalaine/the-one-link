# [[Alcazar]]

Created in a secret lab within Eureka, a group of magitech scientists were hard at work creating a new war golem to surpass the current ones. The old ones lack _something_. They were good at following orders, but once they were left to their own devices, they lacked the ability to adapted to a constantly changing battlefield. That was until an idea was bloomed: they lacked a conscious and free thought! After months of hard labor they finally had a working prototype. Once they implemented the soul energy, Alcazar was born. Now with a conscious and free thought, Alcazar would overhear how he would be a perfect weapon in battle. Such sentences filled the golem with painful thoughts. Was this why he was born? To simply kill and destroy?

One day, Alcazar used his strength and his weapons to break himself free from the facility. Once a good distance away from the city, the golem gave himself a goal. To prove to the world that he was more than a weapon. He would use his gifts to protect those who were weaker than himself. Also to bring a stop to this Golem Research Thinktank from creating more golems like himself.

In his wanderings, Alcazar found himself at a Darham checkpoint. While thinking of a way to get past it he noticed some human guards yelling at a kholo family of three. They were trying to leave the city, but it seems they still broke some sort of rule. Despite the families' pleas, the guards were only getting more aggressive and vindictive. "ENOUGH!", roared Alcazar, pointing at a guard, "You will let them leave. If you hurt them, I will stop you" the guards looked at each other and laughed. The cockiest of the guards strode up to the tin man and tapped him with his baton, "And how are you going to do that?" Suddenly, the guard is punted into a stack of crates, his face black and blue, and Alcazar's big shield hand outstretched into a fist. "Like that" chirped the golem. The other guards, knowing a poor fight when they see one, let the kholo family pass without incident.

Alcazar walked away from the checkpoint. He'd have to find a different town to take shelter in if the guards are like that. Suddenly he is stopped by a woman named Aria. Seeing his act of defiance, she was impressed, and offers the golem to join a group called The One Link. Alcazar agreed to join on the spot.
