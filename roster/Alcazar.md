# [[Alcazar]]

Created in a secret lab within Eureka, a group of magitech scientists were hard at work creating a new war golem to surpass the current ones. The old ones lack _something_. They were good at following orders, but once they were left to their own devices, they lacked the ability to adapted to a constantly changing battlefield. That was until an idea was bloomed: they lacked a conscious and free thought! After months of hard labor they finally had a working prototype. Once they implemented the soul energy, Alcazar was born. Now with a conscious and free thought, Alcazar would overhear how he would be a perfect weapon in battle. Such sentences filled the golem with painful thoughts. Was this why he was born? To simply kill and destroy?

One day, Alcazar used his strength and his weapons to break himself free from the facility. Once a good distance away from the city, the golem gave himself a goal. To prove to the world that he was more than a weapon. He would use his gifts to protect those who were weaker than himself. Also to bring a stop to this Golem Research Thinktank from creating more golems like himself.
