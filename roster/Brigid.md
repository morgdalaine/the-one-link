# [[Brigid|Brigid of the Sunlit]]

**Brigid of the Sunlit**
**Identity:** Free-Spirited Young Huntress from the Desert Clans
**Theme:** Justice
**Origin:** The Dry Expanse
**Quirk:** Empty Hands

Brigid is a member of the Sunlit Clan, one of several bands of nomadic tribes that call the Dry Expanse their home. Her clan is one of a decent size, with a couple dozen family units making up its membership. They mostly travel along the western portions of the Expanse, near its border to Darham, using knowledge passed down from generation to generation to find water, animals, and other supplies. While more "modern" methods of life exist, the Sunlit have a long history of living in harmony with nature. In more recent times, the Sunlit have begun to trade with other communities for things that they aren't able to craft themselves, but there is a concern among many of the elders that abandoning their roots entirely could lead to a collapse of local ecosystems.

As the youngest in a family of seven, Brigid knew that she had to be someone truly unique if she wanted to make a name for herself among the clan. She practiced at night and in secret to hone her body and her technique. At the age of fifteen, she became one of the youngest in clan history to complete her Trial of the Sun - A Rite of Passage where young members of the clan become 'adults' by tracking down the clan as they move, after being abandoned in the wilderness for a week. During that time, she fought as beasts did. Learned the ways that they think, act, fight, and forage. By the time she'd returned, not only had she completed the trial but had also gained new insights that would shape her for years to come.

The next few years saw her becoming one of the most influential women in her clan, a position that came alongside the clan's dwindling numbers as resources became increasingly scarce. The Darham war machine consumes everything around it, and that means invading the lands the Sunlit relied upon for food. Whole food chains were wiped out to fuel Darham aggression, and now Brigid has joined the fight to bring stability to her people.
