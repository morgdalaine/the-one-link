Once a Lord of Darkness that ruled an ancient civilization, the people rose up and slayed his brother, who posed as the 'lord of darkness' to take his stead. His brother told him not to hate humanity, and so his sorrow turned inwards. In his grief he took his library, that which held all of the knowledge in the world, and cast it into the earth along with himself. He sealed his heart away and forgot his vibrant pain. Even now, demons are born from his inner torment and crawl from the earth to bring grief to mortal-kind.

Now in the modern day, a clueless little fellow of a librarian awakes alone in an ancient library beneath the earth. He does not understand where he is, and certainly does not know what is happening. So he packs his library into a little book, as was natural, and journeyed to the surface so that he might learn how mortals live and learn and love in this modern age and write it all in his book.

Long ago, there was an ancient civilization-and that civilization was ruled by an indifferent lord who beheld the world in his palms. He loved to learn, and so oft grew absorbed in reading, failing to listen to the words of the mortals that lived beneath his library that held knowledge of all things. Because of this, he oft gave the task of speaking with the humans to his brother, who held ire towards the mortals, for his brother found them lesser than he.

Relations were bound to strain. The people decried the lord evil, and sent their soldiers and blessed arms and heroes of light to cast him down.

The lord's brother came to him one night, telling him something that he would never forget:

> "After I am gone, please, do not hate the mortals like I have. Love those who live and live with them."

And then the brother was gone, never again to return. The lord heard something absurd - that the Lord of Darkness was slain, and a new, just rule was established.

In his grief, he took the library, that which held all of the world's knowledge, and plunged it into the depths of the earth over one night. Without that knowledge, the civilization of old was doomed to fall to ruin. The Lord fell into an endless slumber, sealing his heart away. His grief spawned many fiends in the depths below the land, some of which crawl out this very day to torment mortal-kind.

A little librarian awakens in the modern day. He does not know where he is. He does not know where anyone is. He is lost and does not understand the world above. Thus, he journeys out on his own, sealing the Library into a book and taking it with his person so that he may record the new age. He will learn of the way people live and love and record it all within his little book.

In days of recent past, The One Link has opened their secret doors to harbor the downtrodden and hide them away from the prying eyes of Darham's disapproval. Each wave of new people would dilute the last, the group growing from a ramshackle few to a real community.

Just about every one of these people, regardless of how old, could say that they remember a few faces that they've always seen around Ortelia. One of those people is 'Pip', an unbothered fellow who occasionally leaves his little world to reach out to others. He always offers something helpful to those who take the time to ask; advice, consultation, trivia… _secrets._

Nobody actually knows where he goes to get all of this privy information when he's always relaxing under the shade, nose stuck deep into a book. Nobody's got the know-how on where this fellow actually came from, or when he came to The One Link. Yet they do know why he aids the movement…

## Classes

Mechanically, he is a tiny knowledge-knight who wields a huge tome.
- **Arcanist** binds him to _The Library_, a re-flavored Oracle/Qilin that contains the collective knowledge of the ancient lands. He literally allows his book to grow in size and swings it around on the now-giant chains that hand bound it shut.
- **Dark Knight** is here to represent his secretly grieving heart and physically demonic nature. I plan on taking everything except for Shadow Strike, focusing especially on 'Painful Lesson'.
- **Loremaster** is the core of his identity. I definitely plan on maxing this class first. He is a knowledge/weakness identifying character first and foremost.
