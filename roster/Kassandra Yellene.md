# [[Kassandra Yellene]]

**Kassandra Yellene**
**Identity:** The Traveller Geomancer
**Theme:** Discovery
**Origin:** Verita
**Quirk:** _Still deciding_

The mysterious Duskveil Gas is the source of many speculation and study. The substance found underneath the mines in the mountais proved to have some kind of power, be it magic or otherwise and that sparked the interest of many in the region. Among those, a particular sorceress who aways studied the magic properties of stones and crystals heard these rumors, and just like that, her tale begun.

Kassandra is a Geomancer, a sorceress focused on the manipulation of the earth itself, more specifically the crystals buried among the rocks and dirt. Her curiosity about these minerals is so great that she even created a partner for her travels made of pure crystals, a dragon like small crature that follows her around, that she called Pristine. As she heard of the rumors about this new substance, her interest picked: what if she could crystallize this material? Could its power be preserved? Compacted? Enhanced? Her mind couldn't stop thinking about it! But things aren't so easy… Although she is a good sorceress, there is so much she don't know yet, and the only way one could gain that power and expertise is through practice.

She grab her pouch, her Staf and her books on Geomancy, and went of in pursuit of knowledge and experience. As her magic grows stronger, so will her understanding of the elements and with that mastery, the ability of bending the elements forming unique crystals, including the elusive gas. This is the beginning of her journey and her research shaw bring many discoveries to Verita and the entire World!

## Kassandra and The One Link

As a researcher, she didn't want to take part in any conflict, especially considering Verita's position on the matter… But things never go as planned, since for her research to bear fruits, she would need to travel to all kinds of places, and this war will not just make it harder to do, it might even destroy many rich mineral sites during the conflict. She got knowledge about that group called The One Link that have some ties with members of the academy, and decided that the best way she could conduct her research, was to have some organization backing it up, even if that was not the prime objective of the organization. So she found a way to contact a person named Arzey, by indication of the same college that hinted at the group's existence. As both sides would win something, they agreed to help each other, and so she became her new life as a member of The One Link.
