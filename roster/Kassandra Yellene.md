The mysterious Duskveil Gas is the source of many speculation and study. The substance found underneath the mines in the mountais proved to have some kind of power, be it magic or otherwise and that sparked the interest of many in the region. Among those, a particular sorceress who aways studied the magic properties of stones and crystals heard these rumors, and just like that, her tale begun.

Kassandra is a Geomancer, a sorceress focused on the manipulation of the earth itself, more specifically the crystals buried among the rocks and dirt. Her curiosity about these minerals is so great that she even created a partner for her travels made of pure crystals, a dragon like small crature that follows her around, that she called Pristine. As she heard of the rumors about this new substance, her interest picked: what if she could crystallize this material? Could its power be preserved? Compacted? Enhanced? Her mind couldn't stop thinking about it! But things aren't so easyâ€¦ Although she is a good sorceress, there is so much she don't know yet, and the only way one could gain that power and expertise is through practice.

She grab her pouch, her Staf and her books on Geomancy, and went of in pursuit of knowledge and experience. As her magic grows stronger, so will her understanding of the elements and with that mastery, the ability of bending the elements forming unique crystals, including the elusive gas. This is the beginning of her journey and her research shaw bring many discoveries to Verita and the entire World!
