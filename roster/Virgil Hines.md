# [[Virgil Hines]]

**Virgil Hines**
**Identity:** A troubled witch, looking for answers
**Theme:** Love
**Origin:** Feraverdé
**Quirk:** Old transport

Virgil ans his older sister Jeanne lived a rather peaceful life at the edges of Feraverdé. Jeanne worked as an assistant at a local clinic, while Virgil helped the farmers they had for neighbours with whatever they may need. They were well-loved members of the community. That was, until Darham Empire came to the doorstep.

It happened suddenly, despite some preparations the government and the city officials have made, their defenses were completely overwhelmed. Virgil and Jeanne were seperated in the commotion, which ended with Virgil being left in the city, while most other civilians managed to get away via train. It wasn't all hopeless though, as a few years ago he and his sister have made a huge gift for one of their farmer neighbours - a plane made of living wood. Virgil managed to get back to the edges of the city and take off, but his escape didn't go unnoticed. A few Darham planes chased after him, but fortunately he managed to shake them off after some time. What wasn't fortunate is the plane's condition after the chase. It was bad enough that Virgil had to make an emergency landing in the woods to try and figure things out.

As he was lowering the plane, he noticed a farm some ways away. He new this was hos best chance at getting help, so after landing he went there straight away. The family he met there wasn't all too happy to see a stranger at their doorstep, but Virgil managed to convince them to let him stay a while. He'd help them around the farm with whatever theyay need, while they give him some food and let him sleep in the barn. The only person who ended up treating him with some degree of warmth was the only son of the family, a young fellow named Brian. He was about the same age as Virgil, so it wasn't too hard for them to find what to talk about on the first night.

Next day when Virgil made a trek to his plane - he realised that this living tree will need at least a few months to heal the damage it sustained, so he waited. Every day he would work tirelessly around the farm, every night he would sit at the barn, talking away with Brian. Slowly, some connection started forming between them. It slowly turned into a genuine, almost childish friendship, and rhat friendship slowly started turning into something more. They'd talk until late into the night, sometimes even spend the night together, falling asleep one after the other. But good things don't last, as both of them will soon find out.

In his free time he would go "for a walk" for a few hours. A trek to the plane and back, maybe a little moment to work on his weapon. "Just in case I need it" he thought, and need it he did. One day, when Virgil finally confirmed that the plane has healed itself, he went back to the farm only to see it surrounded by a garrison of Darham soldiers. The fields were on fire, the barn destroyed and the house's door broken through. The place he'd finally call home, taken away from him once more by the Empire. Pained and enraged Virgil held his recently finished Witchrifle close, as he rushed into the enemy encampment.

It was a long fight, one he barely survived. It was a stupid, impulsive decision. But it was done. The soldiers were either dead or escaped, their machines and automatons laid in wrecks. With blood dripping from his forehead, Virgil made it into the house. The father of the family has died, protecting them, but the rest were nowhere to be seen. Mother, daughter and Brian. Where exactly are they? Virgil found a hastily written note, saying that they're running away. No specific place, not even a direction. There was nothing left to do here. He ran for his plane and took off, not looking back.
