# [[Illianna Iridescia]]

**Illianna Iridescia** 
**Identity**: Rafflesia Princess 
**Theme**: Duty
**Origin**: Darham 
**Quirk**: Stubborn Scion  

The third daughter of the Iridescia family, one of the five head families forming the council of Darham. Out of the 5 families the Iridescia family holds the least power in military prowess, however, their monopoly over fashion, jewellery and the textile industries has led them to reign over high society events. From major private tea parties to seasonal balls and galas all are overseen by the Iridescia family. It is said that regardless of how much money you have, if you are shunned by the Iridescia family your whole lineage would be socially purged from high society. Thus, any young nobles coming of age, desperately attempt to please the Iridescias in hopes for an endorsement or at the very least to remain on their good side.

An endorsement would instantly bring any noble even of a lower standing, straight to the top of high society via a private invitation to a tea party with the Iridescia sisters. The level headed and icy Tatianna, the warm and delicate Brianna and finally, the extravagant yet vicious and unpredictable Illianna. All 3 princesses have held on to the reigns of high society along with setting fashion trends since their debut in high society, although this was to be expected for the Iridescia family.

However, subtle unease lingers amongst the Iridescia faction as the council has continued to skew towards militarisation due to (Insert name of council family whose head of military). As one of the founding families, the Iridescia head (Ulric Iridescia, father of the 3 girls) knows that subjugation using violence only leads to rebellion, however there isn't much they can do due to their limited military strength. But perhaps there is something to be done behind the scenes which require just a little bit more time.  

Illianna like her siblings was trained since birth on ettiquette and noble relations, but the training differed slightly between the 3. Tatianna was to be the level-headed wise figure, tasked for interactions with high ranking officials and nobles involving business and political dealings. Brianna was to be the warm hostess, to possess a sweetness that would erode the guard of any diplomat. And finally, Illianna, her role was to be loud not necessarily in volume, but in presence, to be known and recognised. A vindictive and chaotic disposition in contrast to her beauty, loathed by some, loved by others, however, regardless of what people felt, their eyes would always be drawn to her. 
 
Illianna's love for extravagance in conjunction with her self-obsessed and vicious demaenour is notorious throughout Darham and beyond, a dazzling natural disaster wherever she goes even amongst the commoners. Many would hide as her entourage of guards passed through, but couldn't help but peep to try and get a glimpse of that unfiltered glamour.  

After making a scene at the spring gala (perhaps a little more than what was warranted) due to obnoxious suitors pestering her like flies, she declares that she would be going on vacation as she needed to receuperate after sharing air with 'dirty maggots taken human form'. Conveniently, her itinerary happened to match that of the Darham military movement. A coincidence? Hmmmm…
