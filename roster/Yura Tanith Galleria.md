# [[Yura Tanith Galleria]]

**Identity**: The Soul Thief
**Theme**: Ambition
**Origin**: Athena Island
**Quirk**: Cursed

After the tragedy of her hometown in Athena Island where she lost her Mother and five siblings. Tanith grew up on the streets, learning to steal to make ends meet. She soon discovered that she was pretty good at it. As she grew older and wiser, she also earned a reputation.

One day, a mysterious robed person came to her for her services, requesting a priceless heirloom. The pay was more zenit than Tanith had ever made in her entire life. She was reluctant, she really needed the money badly… Asking many questions about this heirloom and not getting many answers except that it was 'Rightfully theirs' and to 'Not ask so many questions, either take the job or they'll find someone else.' Just as the client was about to walk away Tanith accepted the job and the client gave her the necessary information, the layout for her next heist.

The night finally arrived, Tanith approached the location but was surprised to find that, from the outside, it appeared abandoned, not even a single guard stood out front. But as the thief snuck inside, there were traps abound. This was both dangerous and challenging, a thrill she always sought, but was it really worth this much for the lack of guards? The ease at which she was avoiding and disabling the traps of this place caused her to grow complacent, this lapse caused her to miss an alarm trap that summoned a group of guards. After fighting them off (and sparing their lives) she would make it to the room where the treasure was…

"This heirloom…." It didn't seem like anything special Tanith thought and as she reached out to touch it the world around her faded into darkness and a strange apparition appeared before her. "Your greed has tainted your heart." The strange apparition said, their voice distorted. "Do you realize how much it has hurt those around you, young lady? You will pay the price of your sin by the curse I place upon you. So that you may learn your lesson." With the snap of their fingers a green gem would attach to Tanith and she felt herself weaken, falling to her knees from the heavy weight of the air and nauseating scent. "May you never know true peace so long as your greed corrupts you. To stave off this curse, you must steal the soul treasures of those dark of hearts and purify with this gem. In turn it will purify your soul." They and the heirloom both disappeared leaving Tanith with more questions to ask. How was she to lift this curse? What exactly was she suppose to do? More importantly, what happened to the heirloom?! What was she suppose to tell the client? Struggling, Tanith lifted herself off the ground and walked away.

Leaving the room, she felt a pang in her chest and looked to the green gem that began to glow, softly at first but grew brighter as she approached one of the guards. As she grew closer to the guard, the gem glowed brighter and the pang grew intense. She would reach her hand out to search his pockets but discovered her hand went through his chest and pulled out…. a shiny warhorn? The thief was confused but thought about what the apparition said and brought the shiny warhorn closer to her chest and began to feel lighter and the air less toxic. She felt so alive from this.

So she would slowly begin to discover the powers given to her by this curse and realize it wasn't so bad. As mama said: "Don't despair, keep going." That's exactly what Tanith would do: Go forward and learn more about this strange power.

(A few things like the heirloom, client and apparition were left intentionally blank for GMs to expand upon.)

## Tanith and The One Link

Tanith, like any other thief makes ends meet as best as she can by stealing. It just so happened she stole from the wrong person. Arzey caught her trying to steal one of his more shinier books before she ran off with it. Despite his stoic nature, he was none too pleased to have someone steal from under his nose. Instead of reporting her to the authorities, he would spare her from jail time by offering her a chance to join The One Link.

At first, she wasn't all that thrilled at that prospect of being part of a group. Especially knowing they were a militant group. She didn't want to get into war if she could help it Tanith would quickly change her tune when he told her the benefits of being part of The One Link. He seemed to press all the ambitious bat enkin's buttons at zenit and 'fighting the good fight', which meant fighting challenging foes and taking their soul treasures to keep herself alive (and possibly make a quick zenit if she didn't need to purify her soul gem yet).
