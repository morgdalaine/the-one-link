# [[Vespera Blaed]]

Faced with the grueling reality of being fabricated as a tool of war, Vespera treads forward and joins The One Link. Who will prevail remains to be seen…

Forces are amassing in Darham. The world is changing. The future seems to be at stake.
It's all about war. It always has been for Vespera. She wields a blade made from a mysterious new mineral imbued with her own spiritual essence that allows her _Coeur_ to be manifested as a blade of its own.
A testament toward her identity.

Her past is shrouded in mystery. She's said to be the reincarnation of a past war commander, a Foreseen brought into this world with strange new magics.

How will she reconcile with being used as a tool in a war that she has no say in? Will duty be enough to justify the means?
But more importantly, which side will she take in this war and who will be worthy enough to wield her?
