# [[Chase Nimbus]]

Chase Nimbus
Identity: Morose Survivor
Theme: Enlightenment
Origin: Scherzo, Superbia

In the high society of Scherzo, many people which to become the next big musical hit, and one day, five teens came together to make what we'd soon know as the Nu Men. Also known as the most successful boyband of today. Originally proposed by the human Todd Jones, the best singer of the bunch, eventually the other four came to his idea. Edward Huxley became the daemon who'd serve as their "hot" one, the most charismatic and with the most connections. Mustafar Pigitia? A Tinkermander who'd be their greatest instrumentalist. Tiffany "Biff" Baker, despite his weird name, was the Chira with the best dance moves of the bunch. And our man of the hour, Chase Nimbus, was their songwriter, writing downbeat lyrics at his best and poppyfuntimes when they needed to make money.

Chase and his friends would go on to become the greatest band of their time, becoming popular especially with young adult women because… well it was five hot men all showcasing their wonderful singing voices. Chase himself was always seen as the shy but sweet one, one who wouldn't remove his shirt but would serenade you by the riverside. And importantly, he's the only one still alive-

Right… right, about that. Most bands break up due to a split opinion, or an attempt to expand their musical prowess, but in Chase's case, a… tragedy he doesn't want to expand on resulted in death. A lot of death. Edward's body is MIA, and Mustafar, Biff, and Todd… Chase remembers the last dying look in their eyes, and how he managed to survive without a scratch on his body is a surprise.

Ever since then, his music has reflected his dour personality, and while his adult life has seen a massive amount of success in terms of music, he cannot say that he's been happy in who knows how long. Now, a year and a half after the tragedy, his manager wants her to go out and gain the life experience necessary to make a happy song for once…
