Sombre (Originally the man Haruman Alutair)
Identity: A faceless soldier who has a stolen past
Theme: Vengeance
Quirk: Cognitive Ghost (Flavored to Spiritual Being)

A man who was famed within the Darham empire. his exploits on the battlefield and in the political room was legendary until he vanished for a week. When he returned…nothing changed, in-fact things only got better, and the tactical prowess of the empire increased tenfold. This is where that man's story ends, and we go to what truly happened.

The truth is that Haruman Alutair was accosted and replaced by a man who looks exactly like him. The fate of the famed soldier is that of damnation and doom, however fate had other plans for the fallen hero. Within whatever afterlife, or spiritual coalescence the man was remade, reshaped, and reborn into a being of pure magical energy. All of his features were intact, except his face. The man named Haruman was no more, nothing more than a forgotten reflection of his greatness, he went mad and fled the empire in both fear and insanity.

Years pass as the empire only grew in power and influence, and the being was named Sombre. Legends start to grow around the being, a boogeyman that travels the roadside. A monster that haunts the wicked. All accounts recall one thing correctly however, it screams the name Haruman over…and over. Was it because it's a lost soul slain by the famed her? or just a man who was cheated by him. Only Sombre knows the truth, and that is that Haruman stolen everything from him, his past, his deeds, even his own face and name. He will stop at nothing to kill that man, to kill that creature who dare stolen his life from him.
