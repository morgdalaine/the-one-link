# [[Autumnal Onyx]]

Autumnal could remember the view of a beautifully sterile landscape, the undisturbed grey ash and leaden blue ground— the view of the night sky, with an unperturbed view of the twinkling, brilliant stars dotted upon its dark canvas. Celestial bodies floated upon the air like watchful gods, daunting and ever present.

Then grief. Strong, piercing mourning. One that permeated her entire body, like nails upon a carpenter's board; like corals sinking deep into the flesh of the ocean floor… akin to a terrible shattering of being, so complete and thorough that even the simple recollection inspired enough sorrow and anger that restless spirits were roused alongside, and even the elements were driven to a rage.

Countless storms and rains, countless floods and the insurmountable rage of nature—
It all escapes her at her birth.

"Recollect our sorrow. If we shall never return again to the stars, let us **sterilize** this house, and mold it into a **home**."

She ran like hell, a storm in her veins.
