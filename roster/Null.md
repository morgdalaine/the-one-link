## Her Majesty's Imperial Demon

Technological and arcane advances allowed Imperialists to bind demons to themselves in exchange for another's soul. Forced to serve the Empire, Null committed atrocious acts. She was a weapon, leashed by blood-bound chains, her very essence twisted to obey.

During the Battle of ██, her Bound was killed, leaving her free but stranded—an unmoored fiend in enemy territory. The empire had no use for a rogue asset, and the rebellion had every reason to put her down. Yet, as she reeled from the sudden void in her being, something new took its place: choice.

It was then that ██, a rebel belonging to The One Link, found her. Rather than strike her down, they extended an offer: fight with them, not as a tool, but as something more. A gamble, not out of mercy, but to see if a weapon could truly change.

Is a demon without chains still a monster, or could she be something else?

## Bonds

- [[Yura Tanith Galleria]] **Inferiority**—she's scary but she said she'd protect me.
- [[Autumnal Onyx]] **Loyalty**—shared a "feast" and she made a golden chalice for me to drink wine from.

## Classes

**Arcanist** 2: Bind and Summon (Kizunoha), Quick Summoning
**Entropist** 2: Entropic Magic (Drain Spirit, Umbra)
**Symbolist** 1: Symbolism (Symbol of Forbiddance, Symbol of Truth)

### KUZUNOHA

> The fierce protector of witches and beasts.

**Domains:** animals, lightning, sorcery.

#### MERGE—`Mantle of the White Fox`

You have Resistance to **bolt** damage, and all **bolt** damage dealt by you and by every ally present on the scene ignores Resistances.
You can communicate with creatures of the **beast**, **monster**, and **plant** Species.

#### PULSE—`Crackling Sigil`

Choose one option: you perform a **free attack** with a weapon you have equipped; **or** you perform the **Spell** action for free, casting an **offensive** (⚡️) spell with a **total Mind Point cost of 20 or lower**. If this attack or spell deals damage, you may change its type to **bolt**.

#### DISMISS—`Roaring Thunderbolts`

You deal 20 **bolt** damage to every enemy present on the scene. This damage ignores Resistances; each creature who lost Hit Points due to this damage suffers **dazed**.

## Quirk

### [[Quirks#Fallen Angel|Stranded Demon]]

You are Resistant to **dark** and **light** damage.

Choose an option: you gain a **rare item** worth **1000 zenit or less**; **or** you learn a single [[Spiritist]] spell of your choice; **or** you permanently increase your Mind Points by 10.

Once per session (approximately **four hours of play**), the Game Master can give you 1 Fabula Point to introduce unexpected complications caused by your demonic nature (for instance, some creatures or artifacts could react in strange ways to your presence, and you might draw the ire of celestial creatures).
