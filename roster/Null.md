## ~~Fallen Angel~~ Stranded Demon

> You once dwelled among celestial spheres, basking in the glory of lightâ€¦ but now, you find yourself in this realm of monsters and darkness. Are you here for atonement, to bring light among shadows, or to spy on those who conspire against Heaven? Since your arrival, which of your prejudices were put to the test? Towards which other character have you begun experiencing unexpected feelings?

You are Resistant to **dark** and **light** damage.

Choose an option: you gain a **rare item** worth **1000 zenit or less**; **or** you learn a single **Spiritist** spell of your choice; **or** you permanently increase your Mind Points by 10.

Once per session (approximately **four hours of play**), the Game Master can give you 1 Fabula Point to introduce unexpected complications caused by your demonic nature (for instance, some creatures or artifacts could react in strange ways to your presence, and you might draw the ire of celestial creatures).
