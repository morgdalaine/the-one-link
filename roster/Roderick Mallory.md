**Roderick "Red" Mallory**
**Identity**: Reckless Brawler with a Heart of Gold
**Theme**: Justice
**Origin**: Darham
**Quirk**: Empty Hands

Red never set out to be a hero. He was just a fighter—first in the underground rings of Darham, then in the sanctioned leagues, where he made a name for himself as a relentless boxer with an iron jaw and a left hook that could shatter bone.

It wasn't glamorous, but it put food on the table and gave him something to be proud of. His world was simple: fight hard, win, drink away the pain. But everything changed one fateful night.

It was supposed to be a regular night at the Rusty Nail, one of the rougher joints in Darham. Red was halfway through his third mug when a group of drunk soldiers started picking on a group of non-humans in the corner. A couple of Chira, a young Tinkermander, and an Enkin woman just trying to have a quiet drink. The taunts turned to shoving. Red could have ignored it. He could have looked the other way. But something in him snapped.

He stood up and told the drunks to back off. They didn't listen. What followed was an all-out bar brawl that left three men unconscious and Red bleeding from the lip, laughing through the pain.

The guards came soon after. The non-humans fled, but Red wasn't as lucky. He spent the next few nights in a cell, bruised and hungover, charged with "disturbing the peace" and "interfering with lawful conduct". His boxing license was revoked. His career was over.

With nowhere else to go, Red found himself in the underbelly of Darham, where the growing anti-non-human sentiment was turning uglier by the day. He saw more of what he'd ignored for years—people being driven out of their homes, shops burned, entire families disappearing.

And then the One Link group found him. They needed someone who could take a hit and throw one back twice as hard. Red fit the bill. And for the first time in his life, he felt like he was fighting for something bigger than himself.
