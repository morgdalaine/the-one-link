## Log

> [!danger|right 10%] Times Vespera Was Targeted: 9

WE BEGIN IN MEDIA RES. The Abscondence, a Darhamite train en route from Flewmork to Feraverdé. Six cars to clear before we get to the engine. We must **stop the train before we arrive in Feraverdé**.

### Car 1–A Combat Is You

> Tanith rolls a **10** on our travel roll… two investigators and their hounds (3) occupy the next car.

==+1 Onyx spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==+1 Tanith spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

Dog bites hurt! Ouch! Stop attacking us!

==+1 Null spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll==—please don't hurt me puppy! It's a **16** and yet they keep attacking!?

==+1 Onyx spends a **Fabula Point** to make the dogs not dead! Aww puppy just **playin'** dead!==

### Car 2—Turbulence

> Onyx rolls a **9** on our travel roll…

Wind also hurts??

Onyx ices the wheels while Tanith and Nefer throw bombs at the train cars to slow us down!

### Car 3—More Combat

> Vespera rolls a… **8**!? Is this the final countdown! Two enforces and two investigators

> Don't have me describe a whole thing and then _not_ hit anyone…

==+1 Null spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==**CRITICAL FAVORS**== Tanith demands the enforcer help us move forward. Next **two** travel rolls are a d6! Null demands he also defenestrate himself.

### Car 4—Relaxation Car

> Null rolls a **1**!! The countdown curse is broken!

> [!success] Bonding Scenes
>
> - 【**Affection**】Null relaxes in the hot tub and makes haughty voices with Tanith: "pass me the orange juice _madame_"
> - 【**Loyalty + Loyalty**】Tanith inquires about Vespera's core: Relax a little!

### Car 5—Nondescript Car

> Nefer is redeemed! A **4** travel roll!

### Car 6—Turbulence Too

> Vespera no! a **6** travel roll!

### Engine Car

> An engineer and a conductor! An engine!

==+1 Tanith spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==+1 Tanith spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==+1 Vespera spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==+1 Vespera spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==+1 Null spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==+1 Onyx spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==**CRITICAL BONDING**== 【**Loyalty**】Null and Vespera bond over their shared wooby-esque weapons-of-war mentality and striving for a better future!

==+1 Vespera spends a **Fabula Point** to have the engine blow up in the Engineer's face!==

#### Round 6

WE'RE STILL HERE!? Conductor has died but the Engineer is still here!

OH THANK YOU ONYX HAS SLAIN THE ENGINEER

+12 **Fabula Points** Total
+5 Development Points (Train did not arrive in Flewmork)
