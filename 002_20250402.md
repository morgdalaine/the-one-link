- [[Alcazar]]
- [[Nefer]]
- [[Null]]
- [[Vespera Blaed]]

## Log

Feraverdé, city of spires and domes.

Null is eating crepes. Vespera visits a cathedral. Nefer studies the local pickpockets. Alcazar wanders the city.

A ciphered message from the One Link—meet [[Aradin]] at the **Pink Pony Club**—is delivered to us discretely by street scamps! (Alcatraz is fed through his punchcard mailbox)

> \*_Alcazar and Null touch hands like children_\*

Retrieve a cache of weapons from the desert—three days' travel—and smuggle back into Darham.

> - 【**Affection + Admiration**】Null and Alcazar share a moment tasting the different items on the bar table. Salt, pepper, and a sugar packet.
> - 【**Affection + Admiration**】Nefer explains the benefits of drinking alcohol to Alcazar. "It's like when I had a magnet on my head"

### Desert Travels

Walking through the desert, a heat wave assaults us—beating down on us.

==+1 Alcazar spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

Camping for the night, Alcazar stays in sentry mode. Null burrows into the sand—she's breathes through her tail so don't worry about her.

> - 【**Affection + Admiration**】Alcazar checks in on Vespera—it's hot / I hate sand.
> "What's it like being a robot? / Um. What's it like being human?"

> [!quote|250 right align-right transparent] Null, on Brigands
> Are they going to make me kill them? I'm… I'm supposed to change!

Another grueling day in the desert—when we're ambushed by brigands, offering to take our wares off our hands. Alcazar tries to intimidate them away but it falls on deaf ears. Vespera ends the fight by knocking out 'Billy'. Alcazar offers them food, but Null asks them to join the One Link. Percival and Mabel agree and head back to the Pink Pony Club with 100z.

I hate sand. It's itchy and it gets everywhere and also there's quicksand.

### Arrival

Arrive to a ruined building. There's a trapdoor hatch leading to our quarry—a large wooden box shaped like a coffin. As Alcazar opens the box, monsters pop out!

==**CRITICAL BONDING!** 【**Loyalty**】== Alcazar imparts the different between wanton killing and defending. "They're not people, Null."

==+1 Nefer spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==+1 Alcazar spends a **Fabula Point** to create a secret cache of equipment (Warm Gloves, Rough Gloves)!==

==**CRITICAL BONDING!** 【**Loyalty**】== Alcazar shows Vespera what he got (and makes sure she's okay).

==+1 Vespera spends a **Fabula Point** to add super beautiful special ore to be turned into equipment!==

Alcazar discovers the ruined village is **Karsa**, an old tinkermander village.

### Returning Back

At the checkpoint, Vespera asks the guards not to open the casket—their grandmother's body is inside. Null wails on the casket, "Meemaw! Nooo!"

> [!success] Bonding Scenes

> - We all bond together over our Meemaw's funeral as Alcazar digs the hole and fills it back with an empty coffin.

Aradin gives us **250z** for a job well and new recruits.
