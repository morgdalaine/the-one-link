# [[Szelzemtanc]]

A nation filled with jutting stone karsts, scarred pillars of rock that which aim at the stars with longing, with a distance that only ever seems to increase. Limbs and outlines are carved into the features by the native inhabitants, angels and spirits outlined and defined by the locals; who utilize these stones to make golems with which to work and defend their lands. Some claim they can hear the people within the marble. Most settlements in this nation are founded upon harsh, rough skerries that which repel outsiders and threats while providing a strong base for buildings.

## Tzelectucau

A daunting obelisk; a meteorite, the legends tell, sits upon the middle of this cityâ€” a beacon of something mysterious, a concept that the locals refuse to acknowledge. Buildings cover the surrounding karsts, now matching the monument that which the city was built around on. This city's guards are expressionless statues, with an unerring, marble stare. They watch tirelessly over the city. None dare to touch nor manipulate them, as they only ever serve their Obsidian Clad Queen.
