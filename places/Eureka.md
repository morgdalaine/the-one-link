# [[Eureka]]

A grand city-state built on the ruins of an ancient device. Even today, the city shifts as the rotation of the great gear floors turn ever-clockwise. With each passing generation, the earth grows more still. With each passing generation, the number of minds who can think of a way to keep the heart of the city beating dwindles. One day the whole city may grow cold and still. Magitech is constantly studied and new things are constantly being made. Its governing body, the Assembly is currently debating on staying out of the war or not.
