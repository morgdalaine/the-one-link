# [[Abyssinia]]

Abyssinia was once a great power when Magic was stronger and Bronze was the most powerful alloy in use. Those days are long gone, as Durham took control of the Empire and all of its lands after only one major battle employing Steel and advanced Magitech against the hidebound Abyssinian Army.

They were allowed to keep their polytheistic religion, who's gods and demigods joined Durham's pantheon and were subjugated to Durham's faith in new myths written and forced upon Abyssinia's non-human people in a rare "diplomatic" gesture by the Durham powers that be.

The same workforce that once built grand towering obelisks covered base to tip in etched pictograms inlaid with gold and lapis lazuli are now "employed" in Durham's mines and fields in an economic relationship that borders upon being outright indentured servitude where their pay never surpasses their upkeep, leaving them in permanent debt.
