# [[Verita]]

## Duskveil

A city constantly drenched in a thick fog, standing in the shadow of an ominous mountain range. The city was built around the discovery of large underground deposits of a flammable gas which burns a bright, eerie blue, seen in the lamps which illuminate the city. Many residents devote themselves to the study and applications of this gas as a fuel and power source.
