# [[Darham]]

## Feraverd√©

Is like both Paris and London. The city is haunted by perpetual rain and nobody knows why. All of the architecture has rusted or oxidized, turning green

## Flewmork

The largest inland city of Darham, as well as its capital. Has large amounts of poverty and magical pollution. In terms of the negative policies within Darham, it can be felt the most in here. Ironically was one of the most diverse city in Darham before the hating began.
