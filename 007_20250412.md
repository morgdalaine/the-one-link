## Log

We're on a ~~boat~~ airship en route to Eureka. I can see my house from here!

### Travel Roll—4

A rich-looking Enkin woman, Decarabia, is made uneasy by Null's presence. They exchange awkward waves. "I don't think she likes me, Tanith…" She was told she'd be the only person on the flight? Decarabia is awkward but inquires about my name, how it was stolen. It's all awkward.

==+1 Emanuel spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

### Travel Roll—4

Tanith and Emanuel spots floating islands in the distance. The captain of the airship doesn't seem to notice them? Emanuel informs the captain and we dock at the floating islands. Null find a statue of a woman at the edge of the island.

Tanith senses something _more_ within the statue—magic! A ritual is you!

==+1 Tanith spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==+1 Tanith spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

The angel statue reacts to Tanith's Ritualism and a magic circle appears. The statue turns revealing an orb/gem in her heart—the island begins shuddering and losing altitude.

==+1 Null spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

### Travel Roll—5

We uneventfully arrive in Eureka! Decarabia recommends a restaurant nearby as Null's tummy grumbles. Sombre orders double for Null! Score! Null notices the waitress didn't really take our order—she drew a portrait of rat?

#### We Receive a Unique Consumable

**Eurekan Spicy Honey Glazed Chicken Skewers**: upon consuming, get DEX Up, MIG Up, but suffer **dazed**.

### To the Outskirts of Town

Enkire appears in the desolate town—he's wearing spooky obscuring armor. Asks us to **capture Erkidosc alive** as well as evidence of his treason. He's in the subterranean corridors, wearing similar armor but blue.

### Subterranean Corridors

It's dark and made of metal? Sombre takes the lead with a mistrustful Null right behind.

#### Room 1

> Travel Roll: **7**

An empty room. A ticking sound—gears, cogs, and mechanisms choked with vines. Sombre burns away the plants with a flaming sword. The faucets begin to drip a clear oil that quickly covers the ground. **Eurkan Clock Oil** 300 zenit crafting material

#### Room 2

> Travel Roll: **20**

The shadows have eyes. We follow glowing moss deeper in the hallways to a rusted steel door. Null hands Tanith her wolf's fang to cut the moss off—the door falls off its hinges with a small push.

In the middle of the room, a staff made of strange blue crystal. We are forced to leave it for now, as it seems very stuck in the ground.

#### Room 3

> Travel Roll: **1**

> [!quote|big 50%] Xcesa, Erroneous Spirit
> HELP ME

> THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE DARK
>
> IT'S HERE

We hear voices in the dark: "Experimental… golem… fulgurite…"

A jet black, scary entity hangs from the ceiling with a porcelain face and long jagged claws.

> [!danger|shadow 25% right] Fulgurite Fever
> +20 MP, but suffer **slow** until end of next session

==+1 Tanith spends a **Fabula Point** to invoke her Cursed and not die!==

==+1 Xcesa spends a **Ultima Point** to **escape**.==

==+1 Null spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!== (_I tasted the blood_)

Oh no the blood is liquid onyx fulgurite—I've gone blind, I see a large looming structure in the skies.

Tanith is a coward and won't lick the blood. She investigates the blood: finds blue armor—half digested.

#### Returning to the Staff

The flowers are blooming around Null? Sombre leads the group check!

==+1 Null spends a **Fabula Point** to push **bond**!==

==+1 Tanith spends a **Fabula Point** to push **bond**!==

+250 zenit

Null receives clockwork crystal staff.
Tanith receives 500z soul item.
