## Log

The group of Brigid, Momo, Nefer, Sombre and Virgil entered the raining city of Feraverd√© to create awareness of the cause. Vergil dropped flyers across the city, gathering a crowd to form a protest. As the rebels stood forth together with the rebels to rise the crowd to action.

But the Enforcers came to try and suppress the protesters. together, the party fights back against the aggressive enforcers, driving them all off while keeping up the crowd's morale as they drive off enforcers of their own.

Afterwards, Sombre and Vergil have talks on the feelings of pride and shame in relation to being from Darham.

Meanwhile, the slimy investigator that was leading the harassment group finds himself at the mercy of the Commissary. He's _weak,_ they say, throttling the man around before sending him on his way with a demotion.
This Commissary has now heard of 'The One Link', some sort of protestor group. They vow to uproot them from whereever they are hiding and _crush_ them.
