[[Aria]] escorts us to a ferry for a 3-day mission in Pallamani, Athena Island—will arrive by night. Possibly researching the remnants of ancient civilization of High Kildrath? Need to know more information…

We introduce ourselves! Everyone is very nice. Tanith is scary. Kassandra is cool. Onyx is also scared of Tanith like me.

Why'd we join the One Link! Tanith has a debt to repay! Onyx wants to extirpate Darham (nice!).

Pallamani resembles that one Greece village on the ocean. We go to Tanith's favorite diner!

> Are you ~~cops~~ spies? You have to tell me if you're spies.

An orc—**Rhoboros**—in the diner is an archeologist and is doing work on "the parapet"? The Darham's actions are scaring him. Discovered motherlode of fulgrite stones in the parapet.

A quest! An offer! Come to the dig site! But don't snitch to Darham.

> - 【**Inferiority + Affection**】Null furtively watches Tanith get ready for bed. "You're scary—so you'll protect me right?"
> - 【**Admiration + Loyalty**】Onyx and Null share a "feast" of minibar nuts and discount wine. Onyx makes a golden chalice for Null to drink wine out of.

Meet Rhoboros at the diner and introduces us to **Boss Baus** (human) at High Kildrath dig site "Parapet γ". High Kildrath first civilization to use fulgurite? A glowing cathedral possibly housing fulgurite. Kassandra tears down a fresco but reveals a glowing cavern.

The cavern is _made_ of **onyx fulgurite** filled with carved ruins.

Tanith decodes a sign that says, "⇐Rooms—Crabs⇒". Tanith steps on a plate/goober that releases some _scuttling_ noises—some sort of onyx fulgurite crustaceans!?

### Combat Begins

It's a **fucking crab**!

==+1 Tanith spends a **Fabula Point** to make unstable rocks==_right_ above the crab.

==+1 Null spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==+1 Onyx spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==

==+1 Tanith spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!==a **Soul Steal**!—CRAB'S CLAW

ONYX WITH THE FINAL BLOW!

### Wrapping Up

Boss Baus thanks us (**150z** _each_) but scolds us for breaking a fresco.
Tanith steals a trinket (**100z**) containing onyx fulgurite from the dig site!
Onyx snags onyx fulgurite from the crab's carapace.

Onyx fulgurite levitates out of Kassandra's hand when just a little magic is applied to it!

> - 【**Admiration + Admiration**】On the way to dinner, Kassandra thanks Tanith for help with research and defending her from Rhoboros' accusations.

### A Fishing Job

Tanith picks up a job offer to help an Orokan fisherman. There's oil(?) in the water—a liquid coolant waste. "Hoodlums are dumping junk into the water."

> [!quote] A conversation between Kassandra and Null
> "Y'all, I thought we were here to kill the Darham empire."
> "If you help the people they will give you fish."
> "I like fish."

The hoodlums turn out to be Darham folk who are exerting their "right" to take over the town.
