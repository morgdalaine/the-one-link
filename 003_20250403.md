## Log

The World Tree.

Three members of the party were gathered by a researcher from the World Tree Conservation Effort to subdue a baby Gippsland worm to figure out what was causing their numbers to increase at a rapid rate.

Some time is spent wandering the canopies of The World Tree until they stumble upon the fourth member of the party, Chase the depressed singer

A critical success song from Chase summons the baby gipslin worm to the groups position, burrowing through the ground the worm gets stuck halfway through the surface

## COMBAT START

A whole lot of nothing happens for the first two or so turns mostly due to surprisingly low rolls
The Worm crits!! Fortunately Delphin is immune to the poison damage it would deal!
Sombre and Virgil combo rather nicely with fierce strikes of lightning!
Delphin gets some damage of her own in, this time of the dark variety!
Virgil has some very beautiful roses that much is true
A critical hit from Delphin! Advantage obtained for when it is needed most!

## PHASE 2: A Surprise Visit from Darham

Hippolyta and the Darhamite Conservation and Nature Enhancement Group make a sudden appearance in an attempt to kill the baby worm for their own gains

Hippolyta - Hunter - Hunter - Shaman -

+1 Virgil spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!
Hippolyta has follow-up attacks! 1/6 on the "Save The Baby Worm" clock
Chase takes an arrow to theâ€¦body? Crisis Time!
Delphin with a critical strike! Progressing the clock by an additional 2! 3/6 on the "Save The Baby Worm" clock
A sad, sad song from Chase seals the Shaman's fate! Shaman down and out!
+1 Virgil spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!
+1 Virgil spends a **Fabula Point** to re-roll!
Chase went down, oh no! Surrender Evoked!
_Final Fantasy Victory Music_ Success! 6/6 on the "Save The Baby Worm" clock!
The baby gipslin worm has been safely captured and returned to the World Tree Conservation base camp

Virgil converses with the Darhamian hunters, trying to reason with then and figure out why they were hunting the baby worm. Whether it wormed of not is still up in the air.
